This is a list of ideas for ways to improve the Biochemistry Set

Maybe later
-----------

Find out why main window is different in on-top-ness
Use Dave's generic label class
Monitor all chemicals so their history appears instantly

Place labels at top right of mouse, so pointer doesn't cover them as much?
Scroll labels with graph and stop them flickering if you point to one place?

Colours in injection kit same as in the monitoring graph - 
perhaps make 255 colours and keep each chemical the same colour always?

Histogram style graph
Save and restore all chemical levels in a Norn
Breakpoint if chemical level (or any other monitorable thing)
 changes above/below certain value (in any/all Norns)
Graph of rate of change of chemical
Close all windows
Save all window states
Printing (launch .bmp with "print"?)
Measure time in ticks (with SysTick returning command) - to log file as well
