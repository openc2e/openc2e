This is a list of ways to improve the CAOS Debugger

Basic
-----

Icon graphic

Still crashes when you resize bar between source and watch 

Has crashed on me elsewhere 
Maybe freeze with IPC?

Future
------

Clear monitor button
Copy and paste right menu things

Check all virtual machine returned values work

Put graph module in it, and let you graph an arbitary command

Special values in agent - add more to DBGA

Click on agent in game to select it in tree view

Notice type of something - vehicle etc. pointer
Have mechanism select table according to agent type

Generic command scripts to send to agent in list, or agent in watch window
(TRCK, KILL, CMRT, etc.?)

Breakpoints
 on specific line in specific script
 restrict to specific instance of agent

Run game with each tick driven by the debugger, alternating with
state query commands.

Trace all functions run and in what agent

Step over (ignores subroutines)

Sort agents by room / metaroom
Picture of sprite currently being used

If an agent raises an exception, it dies.  Allow monitoring and analysis of agents which die like this.

Breakpoints
 conditional on anything in watch window
 on watch window value changing for particular agent - for any agent of type?
Jumping (move instruction pointer where you want in current script, "time travel")

Tracepoints (trace when line of code run, and any value from watch window)

Debug install scripts

Message queue monitoring
  show what messages are waiting, and what message launched this script

Profiler :-)

Time travel - log what every agent has done and let you look back over it :-)
